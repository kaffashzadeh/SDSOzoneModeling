This repo holds several scripts for evaluating of the global modeled ozone over Iran using 
a new methodology.

The package is a set of scripts to:

- downscale the models (applying two methods, i.e., LSTM and MLR)
  
- assess the downscaled data

- plot the outputs

- map the stations

More information can be found in: [Assessment of tropospheric ozone products from downscaled CAMS reanalysis and 
CAMS daily forecast using urban air quality monitoring 
stations in Iran](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2023-226/)
